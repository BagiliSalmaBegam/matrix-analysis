\item If two equal chords of a circle intersect within the circle, prove 
that the segments of one chord are equal to corresponding segments of the other 
chord.
\item If two equal chords of a circle intersect within the circle, prove 
that the line joining the point of intersection to the centre makes equal 
angles with the chords.
\item If a line intersects two concentric circles (circles with the same 
centre) with centre $\vec{O}$ at $\vec{A}, \vec{B}, \vec{C}, \vec{D}$, prove 
that $AB = CD$ (see Fig. 
		\ref{fig:chapters/9/10/41} ).

\item Three girls Reshma, Salma and Mandip are playing a game by standing on 
a circle of radius 5m drawn in a park. Reshma throws a ball to Salma, Salma to 
Mandip, Mandip to Reshma. If the distance between Reshma and Salma and between 
Salma and Mandip is 6m each, what is the distance between Reshma and Mandip?
\item A circular park of radius 20m is situated in a colony. Three boys Ankur,
Syed and David are sitting at equal distance on its boundary each having a toy 
telephone in his hands to talk each other. Find the length of the string of each 
phone.
