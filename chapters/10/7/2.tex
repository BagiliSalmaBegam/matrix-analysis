\item To conduct Sports Day activities, in your rectangular shaped school                   
ground ABCD, lines have 
drawn with chalk powder at a                 
distance of 1m each. 100 flower pots have been placed at a distance of 1m 
from each other along AD, as shown 
in Fig. 7.12. Niharika runs $ \frac {1}{4} $th the 
distance AD on the 2nd line and 
posts a green flag. Preet runs $ \frac {1}{5} $th 
the distance AD on the eighth line 
and posts a red flag. What is the 
distance between both the flags? If 
Rashmi has to post a blue flag exactly 
halfway between the line segment 
joining the two flags, where should 
she post her flag?

\item Find the coordinates of a point A, where AB is the diameter of a circle whose centre is $(2,-3) \text{ and }$ B is $(1,4)$.
\item If A \text{ and } B are $(-2,-2) \text{ and } (2,-4)$, respectively, find the coordinates of P such that AP= $\frac {3}{7}$AB $\text{ and }$ P lies on the line segment AB.
\item Find the coordinates of the points which divide the line segment joining $A(-2,2) \text{ and } B(2,8)$ into four equal parts.
\item Find the area of a rhombus if its vertices are $(3,0), (4,5), (-1,4) \text{ and } (-2,-1)$ taken in order. [$\vec{Hint}$ : Area of rhombus =$\frac {1}{2}$(product of its diagonals)]
